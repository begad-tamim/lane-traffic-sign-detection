# Lane Traffic Sign Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to implement real-time detection of road lanes, curves, and traffic signs using computer vision techniques. The project utilizes the YOLOv8 dataset for traffic sign detection and OpenCV for lane detection.

## Objectives
- Detect and track road lanes in real-time video streams.
- Identify and classify traffic signs using YOLOv8.
- Provide a comprehensive solution for lane and traffic sign detection that can be integrated into autonomous driving systems.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is organized into training, validation, and test sets. Each set contains images and corresponding labels formatted for YOLO.
2. **Lane Detection**: Implement lane detection using OpenCV techniques such as Canny edge detection and Hough Line Transform.
3. **Traffic Sign Detection**: Utilize YOLOv8 for detecting and classifying traffic signs in images.
4. **Integration**: Combine lane and traffic sign detection into a single application that processes video input in real-time.
